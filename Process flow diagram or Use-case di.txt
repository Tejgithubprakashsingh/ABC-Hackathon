Blockchain Network
Smart Contract
Data Providers
Process Steps:

Data Collection:
Data is collected from various sources (e.g., IoT devices, user input, etc.).
Data Validation:
The collected data is validated and preprocessed by the AI model.
Data Submission to Blockchain:
The validated data is sent to a blockchain network.
Smart Contract Execution:
A smart contract is triggered, which checks the data and performs actions based on predefined rules.
AI Processing:
The AI model processes the data stored on the blockchain and generates insights or predictions.
Result Storage:
The results generated by the AI model are stored back on the blockchain.
User Interaction:
The user can access the results through an interface, ensuring transparency and immutability of the data.

Use Cases:

Data Input:
The user inputs data that will be analyzed by the AI system and stored on the blockchain.
Data Validation:
The AI system validates the data before sending it to the blockchain.
Smart Contract Trigger:
The smart contract is automatically triggered when specific conditions are met.
Data Analysis:
The AI system analyzes the data stored on the blockchain and provides insights.
Result Storage:
The results of the AI analysis are stored on the blockchain.
Data Retrieval:
The user retrieves data or results from the blockchain.
