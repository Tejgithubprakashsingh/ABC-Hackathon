Architecture diagram of the proposed solution

Architecture Components:
User Interface (UI):

Web/Mobile Application: Front-end interface for users to interact with the system. It provides access to dashboards, data submission forms, AI analysis results, and blockchain data exploration.
AI Engine:

Data Validation Module: Validates and preprocesses user-submitted data.
AI Model: Processes the data to generate predictions, insights, and other analytics.
Blockchain Network:

Smart Contracts: Automated contracts that execute predefined rules when specific conditions are met.
Distributed Ledger: Immutable storage of validated data, AI results, and smart contract execution records.
Node Network: Blockchain nodes responsible for maintaining consensus and data integrity.
Data Storage:

Off-Chain Storage: For storing large datasets that don't need to be on-chain (e.g., raw data used by the AI model).
On-Chain Data: Critical data that needs to be stored immutably and accessed by smart contracts.
Backend Services:

API Gateway: Manages communication between the UI, AI engine, and blockchain network.
Orchestrator: Manages workflows, including the submission of data to the AI engine and blockchain, and triggering smart contracts.
Security & Authentication:

Identity Management: Ensures secure access and identity verification for users interacting with the system.
Encryption: Secures data during transmission and storage, both on-chain and off-chain.
Data Flow:
Data Submission:

Users submit data via the UI, which is validated by the AI engine and stored in off-chain storage.
AI Processing:

The AI engine processes the data, and the results are submitted to the blockchain through the orchestrator.
Smart Contract Execution:

When certain conditions are met, smart contracts are triggered, performing automated actions and storing results on the blockchain.
Result Retrieval:

Users can retrieve AI-generated insights and data from the blockchain via the UI, with data being pulled from the distributed ledger or off-chain storage as needed.
