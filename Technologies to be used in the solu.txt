Technologies to be used in the solution

1. Frontend Technologies
React.js or Angular.js: For building a responsive and dynamic user interface for the web application.
React Native: If mobile application support is needed, React Native enables building cross-platform apps with a shared codebase.
HTML5/CSS3: For structuring and styling the web pages.
Bootstrap or Material-UI: To design a modern, responsive UI framework.
2. Backend Technologies
Node.js with Express.js: For creating the backend services and API Gateway that handle communication between the frontend, AI engine, and blockchain.
Python: As the primary language for AI/ML tasks, integrating well with data validation, processing, and AI model deployment.
RESTful APIs or GraphQL: To structure and handle API requests between the client-side and backend.
3. AI/ML Technologies
TensorFlow or PyTorch: For developing, training, and deploying AI models that will process data and generate insights.
Scikit-learn: For data validation and preprocessing tasks.
Pandas and NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.
Docker: To containerize the AI models, ensuring they run consistently across different environments.
4. Blockchain Technologies
Ethereum: For creating and deploying smart contracts on a public or private Ethereum network.
Hyperledger Fabric: If a permissioned blockchain network is preferred, providing more control over access and governance.
Solidity: The programming language used to write smart contracts on the Ethereum platform.
Web3.js: For interacting with the Ethereum blockchain from the frontend.
5. Data Storage
IPFS (InterPlanetary File System): For decentralized storage of large datasets that do not need to be on-chain.
PostgreSQL or MongoDB: For off-chain storage of non-critical data, providing a relational or NoSQL database structure, respectively.
LevelDB: As a key-value storage for on-chain data in Ethereum clients.
6. Security & Authentication
OAuth2: For secure user authentication and authorization.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): To manage secure sessions and API access.
SSL/TLS: To encrypt data transmission between the frontend and backend.
Metamask or WalletConnect: For secure user interaction with the blockchain network, enabling wallet integrations.
7. DevOps & Infrastructure
Kubernetes: For orchestrating containerized applications, ensuring they are scalable and resilient.
Terraform: For infrastructure as code (IaC), managing cloud resources such as AWS or Azure.
AWS Lambda or Azure Functions: For deploying serverless functions, allowing the execution of code in response to specific events.
CI/CD Pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI): To automate testing, deployment, and monitoring processes.
8. Monitoring & Logging
Prometheus: For monitoring application performance and metrics.
Grafana: For visualizing and analyzing metrics collected by Prometheus.
ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana): For centralized logging, enabling quick searches and analysis of logs from different parts of the system.
